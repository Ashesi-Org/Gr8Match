Technologies Used & Justification:
The application was separated into two main parts, the front-end, which was built using the React framework of Javascript and the back-end, which was built with Django framework from Python. Django handles server-side logic and database interactions, while React manages the client-side user interface. This separation allows for a clean and organized codebase.
The main reason the front-end was built using React instead of an alternative like vanilla HTML is because of the  inherent benefits of its component-based architecture, which promotes modular and reusable code, making it easier to maintain and scale the application. Other benefits like the virtual DOM, Reacts declarative syntax, its affinity for single-page applications, and past experience.
Django comes out of the pack with security services that protect against common web vulnerabilities, a simplified form of database relation with its Object-Relational Mapping and is inherently optimized for rapid development. These are great reasons to choose it over its counterparts like PHP or Flask.
Both Django and React have huge communities that can provide support, a good ecosystem of useful libraries, and very high customization capabilities.
Web hosting is an essential facet of web development, and Amazon Web Services shines in this field. It is highly scalable, very reliable and has a great selection of managed services like Lambda that can make deployment relatively easier and even decrease operational overhead.
